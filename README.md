# BattleShips
Uni project 

Currently has some very bad programming practices and a lot of hard-coded values. Been in a rush. Possibly gonna fix all of it once I have time.

### Launching
##### On windows:
run **BattleShipsW.exe** to run the latest compiled version
##### On Linux:
Have to install sfml. Working on making it linked statically
